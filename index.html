  <h3>My favorite passtime</h3>
  <h5>I have always loved sports and they have always been one of my favorite ways to pass the time. But, if there is
    one sport that really sticks out to me as my favorite passtime, this sport would be Hockey. For most of my life I
    had not played hockey, but I still wanted to play and a few years ago I had the opportunity to start playing. Since
    that day I have always love to spend my time playing hockey.</h5>

  <h3>My least favorite subeject</h3>
  <h5>My least favorite subject in school is religion because I need to complete this course each year of high school. I
    don't mind learning about religion; in fact I love listening to my dad talk about religion. But, in my opinion, the
    way religion is being presented to me is very boring. Also, I don't think that this source will help me advance in
    my life, which is the whole point of high school.</h5>
